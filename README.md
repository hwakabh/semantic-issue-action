- [ ] Initialize default labels with `github-label-setup` command
- [ ] Adjust `CODEOWNERS`
- [ ] Adjust `release-type` in release-please-config.json (default: `python`)
  - See more in documents of [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please?tab=readme-ov-file#strategy-language-types-supported)
- [ ] Replace `GH_USERNAME` and `GH_REPONAME` in CONTRIBUTING.md

Then, you can clean texts above in this section and update with any of descriptions for your project!
